Classification of Human Movement using mmWave FMCW Radar Micro-Doppler Signature

## Problem Statement
The sensor suites needed for autonomous machines to function include varying assortments of sensing modalities. These modalities include LiDAR, RADAR, Cameras, Ultra-sonic, etc. Traditionally, LiDAR and Cameras have provided valuable imaging capabilities. However, there are inherent issues with these sensors that make them unideal of some use-cases, and useless in other use-cases. Namely,
